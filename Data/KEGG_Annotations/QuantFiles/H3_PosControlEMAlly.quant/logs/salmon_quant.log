[2018-04-17 18:52:18.972] [jointLog] [info] Computed 1748 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-04-17 18:52:18.972] [jointLog] [info] Counted 35105 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-04-17 18:52:18.990] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00032744% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (21).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.


[2018-04-17 18:52:18.991] [jointLog] [warning] Only 35105 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.

[2018-04-17 18:52:18.991] [jointLog] [info] Mapping rate = 2.29896%
