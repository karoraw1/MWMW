[2018-03-29 23:55:49.046] [jointLog] [info] Computed 1670 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-03-29 23:55:49.046] [jointLog] [info] Counted 32885 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-03-29 23:55:49.105] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00032744% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (21).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.


[2018-03-29 23:55:49.106] [jointLog] [warning] Only 32885 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.

[2018-03-29 23:55:49.106] [jointLog] [info] Mapping rate = 2.15357%
