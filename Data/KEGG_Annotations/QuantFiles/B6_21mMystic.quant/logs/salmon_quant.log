[2018-04-17 18:50:51.077] [jointLog] [info] Computed 8779 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-04-17 18:50:51.078] [jointLog] [info] Counted 106138 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-04-17 18:50:51.090] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000483878% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (21).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.


[2018-04-17 18:50:51.091] [jointLog] [warning] Only 106138 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
