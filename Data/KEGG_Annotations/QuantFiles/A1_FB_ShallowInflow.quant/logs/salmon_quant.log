[2018-04-17 18:45:44.312] [jointLog] [info] Counted 78651 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-04-17 18:45:44.325] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000666696% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (21).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.


[2018-04-17 18:45:44.326] [jointLog] [warning] Only 78651 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
