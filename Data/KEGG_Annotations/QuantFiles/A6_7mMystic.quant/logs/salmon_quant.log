[2018-03-30 00:42:30.640] [jointLog] [info] Computed 8858 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-03-30 00:42:30.640] [jointLog] [info] Counted 148979 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-03-30 00:42:30.652] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000350307% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (21).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.


[2018-03-30 00:42:30.653] [jointLog] [warning] Only 148979 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
