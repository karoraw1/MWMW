[2018-03-30 00:46:30.571] [jointLog] [info] Computed 522 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-03-30 00:46:30.572] [jointLog] [info] Counted 43046 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-03-30 00:46:30.588] [jointLog] [warning] 5.42187e-05% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (21).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.


[2018-03-30 00:46:30.589] [jointLog] [warning] Only 43046 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
