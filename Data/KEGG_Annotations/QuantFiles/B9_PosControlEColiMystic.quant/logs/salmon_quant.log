[2018-04-10 23:09:52.976] [jointLog] [info] Computed 735 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-04-10 23:09:52.976] [jointLog] [info] Counted 52569 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-04-10 23:09:52.997] [jointLog] [warning] 5.42187e-05% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (21).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.


[2018-04-10 23:09:52.998] [jointLog] [warning] Only 52569 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
