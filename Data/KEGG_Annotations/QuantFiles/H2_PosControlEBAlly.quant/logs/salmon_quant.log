[2018-03-30 00:47:16.566] [jointLog] [info] Computed 1201 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-03-30 00:47:16.566] [jointLog] [info] Counted 115157 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-03-30 00:47:16.578] [jointLog] [warning] 5.63038e-05% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (21).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.


[2018-03-30 00:47:16.579] [jointLog] [warning] Only 115157 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
