[2018-04-13 19:02:36.426] [jointLog] [warning] 5.63038e-05% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (21).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.


[2018-04-13 19:02:36.427] [jointLog] [warning] Only 146691 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
