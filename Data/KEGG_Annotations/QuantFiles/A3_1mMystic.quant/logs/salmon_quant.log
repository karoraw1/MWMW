[2018-04-10 23:04:52.281] [jointLog] [info] Computed 10162 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-04-10 23:04:52.281] [jointLog] [info] Counted 102862 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-04-10 23:04:52.298] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000320713% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (21).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.


[2018-04-10 23:04:52.299] [jointLog] [warning] Only 102862 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
