[2018-03-29 23:49:08.407] [jointLog] [info] Computed 7388 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-03-29 23:49:08.407] [jointLog] [info] Counted 72999 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-03-29 23:49:08.447] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000320713% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (21).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.


[2018-03-29 23:49:08.448] [jointLog] [warning] Only 72999 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.

[2018-03-29 23:49:08.448] [jointLog] [info] Mapping rate = 1.0179%
